Weclome to Fan Controlled Movie Studios! We make the movies you want to see, literally! We take our fans suggestions and turn them into full length feature films. Thank you for testing out our idea submission web application!

This application allows users to create an account and then submit movie ideas with a 500 character description of the plot. Users can also see movies submitted by other users as well!

Please open the FCMS folder in your terminal and type 'shotgun'. Once you have done that, navigate to localhost:9393 in your web browser and begin submitting ideas!
